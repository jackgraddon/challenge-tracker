# Challenge Tracker
A simple tracker for challenges with numeric values.
Currently, it just tracks challenges and looks neat. I will be updating it with more functionality as I have time.

## Key Features
- Track number-based challenges (e.g., 50/100).
- Name and describe challenges to keep track of them.
- Stores all info in browser storage.
- Export challenge data to load on a different device. (TODO)
  - Possible: Sync across devices? (TODO)

## TODO
- Fix displaying on github pages url, find an actual domain to host this.
- Modify editing workflow to be easier to use for quick edits.
- Add tags to sort and organize challenges.
- Use the deadline to show more importance on upcoming tasks.
- And many more...?

###### Little Note
###### I am using this project to learn Vue.js, and feedback is appreciated! I want to be the best I am able to, and I can only get better when I am told I am wrong. But please do try to be polite, I am new :) Thank you!
